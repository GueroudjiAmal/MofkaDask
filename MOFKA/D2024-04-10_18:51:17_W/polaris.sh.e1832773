[1;93m==>[0m Warning: setting 'compiler:', 'target:' or 'provider:' preferences in a package-specific section of packages.yaml is deprecated, and will be removed in v0.22.

	These preferences will be ignored by Spack, and can be set only in the 'all' section of the same file. You can run:

		$ spack audit configs

	to get better diagnostics, including files:lines where the deprecated attributes are used.

	Use requirements to enforce conditions on specific packages: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages_yaml.html#package-requirements
